Overview:
These two-fold characteristics enable Cythonâ€™s two major use cases: 
A. extending the CPython interpreter with fast binary modules, and 
B. interfacing Python code with external C libraries.
C. Roadmap: Python file > C file > Assembly file

To test cython code, here are the following required C compilers to be installed:
1. Microsoft C++ Build Tools (for windows)
2. GNU C Compiler (GCC) / build-essential and/or python3-dev (for linux or mac)

Method to compiled the cython file:
1. Through setup.py via cli or programmatically
2. Through cythonize via cli or programmatically
